Fully implemented, orginal docker-compose etl.
This is as functional etl as work in progress. I've learned docker on this project so there are places where configs/envs are specified in couple of spots.

Todo:
- clean configs
- clean config vars and inputs
- create clean and easy setup - init script
- split amazon dag into multiple steps
- add tests
- write documentation
